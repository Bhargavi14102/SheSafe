In recent times, the problem of email spam has escalated due to the exponential growth of internet users. Spammers are using email spamming for illegal and unethical activities like phishing and fraud. They create fake email accounts and profiles to deceive innocent people who are unaware of such frauds. These spammers use spam emails to send malicious links that can harm your system. Therefore, it is crucial to identify and filter out fraudulent spam emails. This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to detect spam emails with the highest precision and accuracy. The various algorithms will be applied to the datasets, and the best algorithm will be chosen for email spam detection.
